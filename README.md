## About the game
You can start the game by opening the scene in Assets/Scene and click the Play Button in Unity. The goal for this game is to find the drowning man overboard within the given time.

* 90 seconds to save the drowning man
* If the sound for left and right are reversed, revert the 180° y-rotation on Camera > GameObject > Audio Listener to 0° again. That change was necessary for me to hear it right on my pc
